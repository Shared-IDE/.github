# Shared IDE

Shared IDE is an advanced, browser-based collaborative coding platform designed to replace traditional, limited tech interview editors. It provides real-time collaboration between two users, allowing them to run code with terminal-like output and leverage AI assistance. The platform is built to support pair programming and makes technical interviews more dynamic and interactive.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Collaboration**: Two users can work together on the same codebase in real time, with changes reflected instantly for both participants.
- **Code Editor**: Replaces traditional tech interview notepad-like editors with a fully-featured, browser-based code editor.
- **Run Code**: Includes a "Run Code" option to execute code directly in the editor, with terminal-like output for debugging and troubleshooting.
- **AI Assistance**: Integrated AI available for code suggestions and enhancements. AI can be enabled or disabled by the session creator, but it applies equally to both participants, ensuring a consistent and fair experience.
- **Seamless Pair Programming**: Built to support pair programming workflows for interviews, coding sessions, and debugging in an intuitive, shared environment.
